  <!--
    Stand‑alone events page

    This page provides a full‑screen view of upcoming Charleston tech events.
    It consumes the same data as the homepage overlay but presents it in a
    dedicated, scrollable layout.  Events are grouped into friendly
    categories such as “Today”, “This Week”, “Next Week” and so on.  If
    fetching from the remote API fails the page automatically falls back
    to a bundled JSON file under assets/data/events.json.

    To integrate this page into the site simply add a link pointing to
    /events.html from your navigation.  No server‑side rendering is
    required – everything is handled client side via eventsPage.js.
